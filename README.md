**üß† Mental Health Analysis**
# üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes a Mental Health Survey Dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and predictive insights regarding mental health issues, treatment-seeking behavior, stress levels, and coping mechanisms.

The analysis covers:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend & Correlation Analysis

Time Series Analysis

Machine Learning Models (Prediction)

Dynamical Systems Modeling (SIR-like model for stress dynamics)

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains survey responses about mental health, including demographic details, occupation, treatment, family history, stress levels, and coping struggles.

# Key Features:

Demographics: Gender, Country, Occupation

Mental Health Indicators: Treatment, Family History, Stress Levels, Mood Swings, Coping Struggles

Timestamp: For time-series analysis

# üîß Data Preprocessing

Converted Timestamp to datetime and extracted year-month.

Encoded categorical variables (Gender, Country, Occupation).

Missing values in self_employed replaced with "Not Specified".

Removed duplicate entries.

# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
General Distributions

Occupation: Highest respondents were Housewives.

Gender: More male respondents, especially house-husbands.

Country: USA had the largest number of respondents.

Treatment Seeking: ~50.4% respondents sought treatment; ~49.6% did not.

Family History: ~39.5% reported family history of mental illness.

Trend Analysis

Mental Health History vs Occupation: Strong variations across professions.

Days Indoors vs Stress: More indoor time correlated with increased stress.

Correlation Analysis

Family History & Treatment: Respondents with family history were more likely to seek treatment.

Work Interest vs Mental Health: Work interest levels were associated with mental health history.

‚è≥ Time Series Analysis

Respondents Over Time: Fluctuating participation by occupation.

Treatment Trend: Treatment-seeking showed gradual increases over time.

Mood Swings Trend: Fluctuating but visible high/medium categories.

Growing Stress Trend: Stress levels increased during certain periods.

Coping Struggles: Noticeable variation across time, with peaks in certain months.

# ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
# Goal

Predict whether a respondent will seek treatment based on stress, gender, and family history.

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Features: Gender, Stress Levels, Family History

Target: Treatment (Yes/No)

Results

Accuracy: ~0.78 ‚Äì 0.80 (with cross-validation)

Confusion Matrix: Showed a balanced classification between treatment-seekers and non-seekers.

Classification Report: Strong precision and recall across both classes.

# üîÑ Dynamical Systems Modeling

A SIR-like model was applied to represent transitions between mental health states:

Healthy (S): No stress, no coping struggles.

Stressed (I): Experiencing stress and coping struggles.

Recovered (R): Took treatment and no longer stressed.

# Estimated Parameters:

Œ≤ (Infection/Stress Rate): Derived from transition into stress.

Œ≥ (Recovery Rate): Derived from treatment and stress reduction.

Initial Conditions:

Healthy: 15.9%

Stressed: 68%

Recovered: 16.1%

# Findings

The model effectively simulates stress spread and recovery over time.

Graphs show stress (I) dominating initially, but recovery (R) increases steadily as treatment uptake grows.

# üìà Key Insights

Nearly half of respondents avoid treatment, despite high stress indicators.

Family history strongly increases treatment-seeking likelihood.

Increased indoor time is associated with higher stress.

Predictive modeling can reasonably classify treatment seekers (~80% accuracy).

Dynamical system models offer a new perspective on mental health progression across populations.

# üå± Strategies for Improving Mental Health

Based on the findings, the following strategies can be suggested:

Encouraging Treatment-Seeking Behavior

Awareness campaigns to reduce stigma around mental health.

Accessible and affordable therapy options.

Peer support programs for those reluctant to seek professional help.

Addressing Family History Risk

Early screening for individuals with a family history of mental illness.

Preventive counseling sessions and monitoring.

Promoting open family discussions about mental health.

Managing Indoor Stress Levels

Encouraging regular outdoor activities and physical exercise.

Promoting healthy work-from-home routines with breaks.

Mindfulness practices like meditation, yoga, and breathing exercises.

Workplace & Occupational Support

Flexible work schedules to reduce stress.

Mental health workshops at workplaces.

Confidential employee assistance programs (EAPs).

Building Coping Skills

Providing stress-management training.

Group therapy or community support sessions.

Access to mobile apps for guided meditation and emotional tracking.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy

Models: Random Forest, Cross-Validation, SIR Dynamical Model

Visualizations: Time Series, Correlation, Distribution, Confusion Matrix

# üìå Conclusion

This project provides statistical, predictive, and system-dynamic insights into mental health patterns. It highlights the importance of family history, stress exposure, and treatment behavior in shaping mental health outcomes, while also showing how preventive strategies and system-level interventions can help improve mental well-being.
